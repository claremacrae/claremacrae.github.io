The cows on Midsummer Common in Cambridge are now on Twitter: [**Daisy Bullocks**.](https://twitter.com/DaisyBullocks)

The [delightful banter and corny jokes](https://twitter.com/DaisyBullocks/status/464903952480608256)
there brought back my earliest internet humour memory, from cam.misc.

The 1995 thread was called “Council mission to terminate all cyclists
(and pedestrians)”. After a fair amount of googling, I can’t find it
archived online, so I scanned it in.

First, the intro – from Cllr Ian Nimmo-Smith:

And then the absolutely delightful reply from Jeremy Johnson:
