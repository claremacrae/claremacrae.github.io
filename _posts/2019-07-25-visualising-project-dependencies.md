I've written up **[two approaches I've used to visualise the dependencies](https://github.com/claremacrae/project_dependencies_viz#top)** between programs, libraries and third-party code in large bodies of code.

You can view the example files for the first approach [here](/images/project_dependencies/all-targets.svg).

(This started off as a short answer to a question this morning on the [#include <C++> Discord server](https://www.includecpp.org/) - and then it kind of grew!)
