On 2018-06-19, Llewellyn Falco and I were interviewed for the Greater Than Code podcast.

We talked about what we'd learned whilst remote-pairing for nearly 2 years, and what we've learned from writing documentation for an open source library.

For more info and to listen to the recording, see [the episode and shownotes](https://www.greaterthancode.com/pairing-and-sharing).
