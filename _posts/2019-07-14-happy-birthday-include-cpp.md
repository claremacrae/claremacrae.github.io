## Making a welcoming, more diverse C++ community

Two years ago today, Guy Davidson tweeted a [delightful and somewhat corny C++ joke](https://mobile.twitter.com/hatcat01/status/885973064600760320): 

[![Why isnâ€™t there a C++ diversity group called #Include ?](/images/GuyDavidsonIncludeTweet.png)](https://mobile.twitter.com/hatcat01/status/885973064600760320)

So today is the perfect day to say a heart-felt "thank you" to the wonderful **[#include<C++>](https://www.includecpp.org)** community that has evolved from that post, and from Kate Gregory's swift reply ["Let's start it. First get-together at @CppCon; another at @meetingcpp"](https://mobile.twitter.com/gregcons/status/886740721906184192).

Kate today published an excellent summary of all that we have achieved in these two short years:  [Happy-One-of-our-birthdays, Include!](http://www.gregcons.com/KateBlog/HappyOneofourbirthdaysInclude.aspx) - an amazing amount.

The C++ conferences I've been to in the last two years feel noticeably more friendly, with a wider variety of people present, and a healthier gender balance, than any of my previous C++ conference experiences. 

It has been a huge honour to have played a small part in the evolution of this global, inclusive, and diverse community for developers interested in C++.

I've also benefited greatly from this lovely community - learning about other people's experiences, gaining support in my journey speaking at C++ conferences, and getting answers to some thorny technical and non-technical questions too!
 
If you are interested in C++ in any way, I encourage you to say hello on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/include_cpp), or better yet, join our **[friendly, supportive community on Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/ZPErMGW)**.
