## #include<cpp>

I wanted to celebrate the achievements of [#include<C++>](https://www.includecpp.org), in just two short years since Guy Davison's original tweet on 14 July 2017.

Kate Gregory has written an excellent summary of the first two years of [#include<C++>](https://www.includecpp.org):  [Happy-One-of-our-birthdays, Include!](http://www.gregcons.com/KateBlog/HappyOneofourbirthdaysInclude.aspx)
