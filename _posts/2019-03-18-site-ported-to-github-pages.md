This site was originally on commercially-hosted WordPress. Today I've started moving it to github pages.

The following pages were really useful in this process:

* [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) - a very useful tutorial.
* [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/) - which helped me install Jekyll on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
* [Testing your site locally](https://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/local_test.html) - which told me how to build the site locally.
