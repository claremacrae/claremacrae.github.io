## Testing code in CLion

I've been invited by JetBrains to give a webinar on CLion, and this is all set for Tuesday, February 16 2021, and the title is "**Testing Superpowers: Using CLion to add tests easily"**.

CLion is great for refactoring C++ code to make it more maintainable - but it's well-known that you need tests to be able to refactor safely.

In this webinar, I'll show you how **quickly get started adding tests to untested code**.

Find out more, and **book your place** [on the JetBrains website](https://info.jetbrains.com/clion-webinar-february-2021.html).
