On the 8th October, just after I got back from post-CppCon travels around Colorado, I had the huge pleasure of being interviewed by Jon Kalb and Phil Nash for the cpp.chat podcast. I really enjoyed the conversation.

For more info and to listen to the recording, see [the episode and shownotes](https://cpp.chat/64/).
