I had so much fun this morning at a Cambridge Raspberry Jam programming
workshop for kids that it seemed a fitting subject for my first blog
post‚Ä¶

[Carrie Anne Philbin](https://twitter.com/MissPhilbin) ran a
music-making workshop for 32 school kids, using the [Sonic Pi
programming
environment](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/sonicpi/) on
[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) computers. I was one of
about half a dozen volunteer helpers.

When I originally signed up, I really wasn‚Äôt sure how much I‚Äôd be able
to help, but after an hour or two this morning of reading through the
Sonic Pi chapter of Carrie Anne‚Äôs great book, [Adventures In Raspberry
Pi](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118751256.html),
then writing my own [crib
sheet](https://github.com/claremacrae/raspi_code/blob/master/sonic_pi/sonic_pi_notes.md)
and trying out [some sample
code](https://github.com/claremacrae/raspi_code/tree/master/sonic_pi), I
felt quite confident.

I had also wondered what a room full 16 Raspberry Pis, all synthesizing
sounds, would be like‚Ä¶ luckily, each machine was supplied with a
splitter and two sets of headphones. So I started by testing out one of
the machines ‚Äì and the sound worked fine. (It turned out later that
testing just one was a bit optimistic.)

As parents and kids started arriving, my focus moved to looking out for
kids who didn‚Äôt have anyone to sit with, and finding them spaces. I got
some nice feedback on that from a couple of the parents.

I was really impressed by Carrie Anne‚Äôs teaching‚Ä¶ Not surprisingly,
given her experience, she has a great way of explaining things very
clearly and enthusiastically. I could tell that her choice of vocabulary
was well-considered‚Ä¶ just enough information, and a lovely way of asking
questions to get the kids thinking.

And both she and [Alex Bradbury](https://twitter.com/asbradbury/) were
especially good at trouble-shooting, when it turned out that around a
third of the pairs of kids had problems with the sound just not working.
Apparently this is really rare in these workshops, but today we were
unlucky: it was a shame, as it took some time away from learning‚Ä¶
Despite that, it definitely seemed like all the kids were engaged, and
got a long way through the excellent worksheets.

I reckon I spent at least a couple of minutes with probably a third of
the pairs of the kids in the room at one point or another, and the
mugging up this morning really paid off.

One minor challenge for me was avoiding just telling them the right
answer ‚Äì but instead trying to help them figure things out. A particular
highlight was helping one pair work out how to write a loop from 60 to
70 in Sonic Pi‚Ä¶ At first, they set the initial value inside the loop, so
it was never going to work‚Ä¶ A few carefully worded questions, and they
worked it out!

I was also interested to know the mix of girls and boys attending, so
kicked myself for not counting early on ‚Äì i.e. before the
juice-and-biscuit break, after which attendance got a bit more random.
But I reckon that there were at least 9 girls out of 32 kids present.

Based on today‚Äôs experience, I‚Äôll definitely be looking out for future
local kids programming workshops to help at.

And I‚Äôd really encourage anyone who enjoys programming to volunteer at a
kids workshop near you. You can find out about future Raspberry Jam
events via
[RaspberryJam.](http://raspberryjam.org.uk/ "#RaspberryJam")And if you
can spare time regularly, there‚Äôs [Code
Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/).
