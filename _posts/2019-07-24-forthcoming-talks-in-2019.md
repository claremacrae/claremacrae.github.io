I'm delighted to announce I'll be speaking at these events later this year:

| Date  | Conference | Title and Abstract |
| - | - | - |
| **2019** | &nbsp; | | &nbsp; | | &nbsp; | | &nbsp; | | &nbsp; |
| 2019-09-04 | [ACCU Cambridge, UK](https://www.meetup.com/ACCU-Cambridge/) | [Quickly Testing Legacy C++ Code with Approval Tests](https://www.meetup.com/ACCU-Cambridge/events/262761572/) |
| 2019-09-16 | [CppCon 2019 Conference, Aurora, CO, USA](https://cppcon.org/) |  [Quickly Testing Legacy C++ Code with Approval Tests](https://cppcon2019.sched.com/event/Sfdj/quickly-testing-legacy-c-code-with-approval-tests) |
| 2019-11-15 | [Meeting C++ 2019, Berlin, Germany](https://meetingcpp.com/2019/) | Quickly Testing Qt Desktop Applications |

The first two are significant updates to previous talks, and the third one is a brand new talk. 

I've started a [Presentations](/conferences/presentations.html) page to keep track of my talks - past and future.
