## The Conference

On Tuesday I had the honour of speaking at the 3rd edition of [CppEurope](https://cppeurope.com/) in Bucharest, Romania. This one-day conference was sold out, with more than 200 people attending.

The conference is hosted by [Mosaic Works](https://mozaicworks.com/), whose [YouTube Channel](https://mozaicworks.com/blog/think-design-work-smart-youtube-channel/) I've been following with interest, lately.

Things I particularly liked about the conference:

* Good variety of talks
* Great food
* Retrospective at the end of the day
* Speakers really well looked after
