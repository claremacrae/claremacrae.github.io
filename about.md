# About Me

## My background

This will date me, but my first programming experiences were working
through [Donald Alcock’s Illustrating
Basic](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/cgi/archive.pl?type=Books&platform=&author=Donald%20Alcock&publisher=&order=Publisher)
with my Dad! My timing at school was lucky, as I got there just in time
for the first [BBC Micro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) to
arrive. Then Dad got a [Transam Tuscan](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/7010/Transam-Tuscan-S100/),
and the days of hand-writing instructions to send away to be typed up
were over.

At University, I was able to keep up the programming interest in my
fourth year, when I did a computational chemistry project in [Professor
Graham Richards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Richards)' lab, for
the Part II of my chemistry degree.

From there, in 1987 I got a job as a junior programmer at [Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/) (CCDC). Apart
from a brief 6-month stint in sales at [Oxford
Molecular](http://www.isis-innovation.com/spinout/oxmol.html) in early
1991, I’ve been a developer at CCDC ever since.

## Working life

By day, I’m now the Database Development Manager at
[CCDC](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/) – leading the team responsible for
delivering
[CSD-Xpedite](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/SUPPORTANDRESOURCES/Support/Pages/SupportSolution.aspx?supportsolutionid=304).
Our continued adoption of [Agile software development
practices](http://agilemanifesto.org/) played a significant part in our
ability to deliver CSD-Xpedite. (I say “continued adoption” of Agile, as
I don’t believe it’s a state ever achieved, but more a continuous
journey of improvement.)

When I’m programming there, it’s mainly in C++ and Qt, though very
occasionally my days of Fortran 77 come back to haunt me, as I’m one of
only 2 or 3 remaining people familiar with our oldest code that’s still
in use.

Although I rarely work on it directly now, I remain very proud of our
[Mercury](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Solutions/CSDSystem/Pages/Mercury.aspx)
crystal structure visualisation program. I was the original, and then
lead, developer of Mercury from 1999 until around 2010.

## Scripting and automation

I’m passionate about using computers to save time. This means I’ve
contributed to CCDC’s software build and version control systems for
decades. In 2009 and 2010 I lead major efforts to streamline our release
processes, which had required many time-consuming manual steps.

At work and at home,  I’m a keen user and advocate of the
keystroke-saving tool [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) and I
dabble in Python.

## Learning

I often attend evening talks organised by [Software
East](http://softwareast.ning.com/) and I really appreciate their
support of the Cambridge software development community. I’ve also
enjoyed the rare occasions I’ve been able to go to [Skills
Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/) events in London.

A particular focus over the last year or so has been learning about
[Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and
[Continuous Deployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery).

I’ve developed quite a sophisticated system for capturing things I
learn, and useful references – all stored in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format, in
Dropbox. On PCs, I use [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/)
([Pro](https://markdownpad.com/buy.html)). On iPad, I use
[Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) – where various customised
[actions](http://omz-software.com/editorial/docs/ios_workflows/reference.html) provide
a slick way to transfer information from Twitter and RSS feeds into
Markdown. Both these applications are highly recommended.

## Interests

I love folk music, and am always on the lookout for good music, both
locally and further afield.

Between 1995 and 2010, I was very involved in [Cambridge Cycling
Campaign](http://www.camcycle.org.uk/), including being coordinator for
many years.

For years, I was a keen table tennis player in local leagues,
representing Cambridgeshire, and eventually playing in Grand Prix
tournaments and making it to the UK national ranking list.

These days, although still cycling, more of my spare time goes on
computing projects. Besides Python and Markdown, the current focus is
enjoying the Raspberry Pi that I bought in April 2013, after hearing
Eben Upton’s inspiring keynote talk at the ACCU conference in Bristol.

In May 2014 I became a [STEM
Ambassador](http://www.stemnet.org.uk/ambassadors/what-do-stem-ambassadors-do/).
I’m keen to support local educational computing projects, especially
ones involve the Raspberry Pi.
