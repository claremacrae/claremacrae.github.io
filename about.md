## Clare Macrae Consulting Ltd

I am an independent consultant, helping teams streamline their work with legacy and hard-to-test C++ and Qt code.

My mission: **Sustainable and efficient testing and refactoring of legacy code!**

I've worked in software development for over 30 years, and in C++ for over 20 years.
