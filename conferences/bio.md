# Clare Macrae Conference Bio

Clare has worked in software development for over 30 years. She is a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, which releases data and powerful software for scientific education, research, and streamlining the design and manufacture of new medicines.

From 2016 to 2018, she lead the team that replaced their 30 year old database format and Fortran code. She has now returned to C++ and Qt, working on the popular 3D crystal structure visualisation program [Mercury](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/mercury/), which she was the original author of.

Since 2017, Clare has used her spare time to work remotely with Llewellyn Falco on [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp), to radically simplify testing of legacy code.

When not thinking about supporting teams to streamline development, testing and releases, she spends time with family and friends, and enjoys the Raspberry Pi, folk music and cinema.
