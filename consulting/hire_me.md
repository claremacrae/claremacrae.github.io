I am an independent consultant, helping teams streamline their work with legacy and hard-to-test C++ and Qt code.

My mission: **Sustainable and efficient testing and refactoring of legacy code!**

I run **Clare Macrae Consulting Ltd**. I'm based in Cambridge, UK, and I am available to work either on-site or remotely. 

Please [contact me](/contact_me.html) to talk about ways I can help your teams, or see my [Conference Bio](/conferences/bio.html), for more about my broad professional experience.
