## Clare Macrae Consulting Ltd

I am an independent consultant, helping teams streamline their work with legacy and hard-to-test C++ and Qt code.

My mission: **Sustainable and efficient testing and refactoring of legacy code!**

I'm based in Cambridge, UK - and am available to work either on-site or remotely. 

Please [contact me](/contact_me.html) to talk about ways I can help your teams.
