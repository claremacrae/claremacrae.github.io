## What the course offers

![Intent](/images/approval_tests_course_2020_09/course.intent.png)


You've inherited some legacy code: it's valuable, but it doesn't have tests, and it wasn't designed to be testable, so you need to start refactoring. But you can't refactor safely until the code has tests, and you can't add tests without refactoring! How can you ever break out of this loop?

Whether Legacy code for you means "old code", "code without tests", or "code you wish to redesign for new features or unit-tests", this workshop will enable you to become productive and work safely, quickly.

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn not just how to use Approval Tests to start testing legacy code, but how to create effective, maintainable, expressive tests, even on large systems.
