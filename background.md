## Early Days

This will date me, but my first programming experiences were working
through [Donald Alcock’s Illustrating
Basic](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/cgi/archive.pl?type=Books&platform=&author=Donald%20Alcock&publisher=&order=Publisher)
with my Dad! My timing at school was lucky, as I got there just in time
for the first [BBC Micro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) to
arrive. Then Dad got a [Transam Tuscan](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/7010/Transam-Tuscan-S100/),
and the days of hand-writing instructions to send away to be typed up
were over.

At University, I was able to keep up the programming interest in my
fourth year, when I did a computational chemistry project in [Professor
Graham Richards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Richards)' lab, for
the Part II of my chemistry degree.

From there, in 1987 I got a job as a junior programmer at [Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/) (CCDC). Apart
from a brief 6-month stint in sales at [Oxford
Molecular](http://www.isis-innovation.com/spinout/oxmol.html) in early
1991, I was a developer at CCDC until June 2019.

## Former Working life

Until June 2019, I was a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at
[CCDC](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/).

Recent projects included:

* leading the team responsible for
delivering
[CSD-Xpedite](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/SUPPORTANDRESOURCES/Support/Pages/SupportSolution.aspx?supportsolutionid=304)
* leading the project that [replaced the ASER database format](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/2017-12-14-csd-release-2018/). 
* implementing the [Polyhedral display style in Mercury](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/blog/greater-structural-insight-and-clearer-visualisation/). 

CCDC's continued adoption of [Agile software development
practices](http://agilemanifesto.org/) played a significant part in our
ability to deliver CSD-Xpedite. (I say “continued adoption” of Agile, as
I don’t believe it’s a state ever achieved, but more a continuous
journey of improvement.)

When I was programming there, it was mainly in C++ and Qt.

With the replacement of ASER in our releases in late 2018, we archived more than three decades worth of FORTRAN 77 code, so that's a skill that I no longer use.

I remain very proud of the CCDC's
[Mercury](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Solutions/CSDSystem/Pages/Mercury.aspx)
crystal structure visualisation program. I was the original, and then
lead, developer of Mercury from 1999 until around 2010. In December 2018 I returned to working on Mercury.

## Scripting and automation

I’m passionate about using computers to save time. This means I’ve
contributed to CCDC’s software build and version control systems for
decades. In 2009 and 2010 I lead major efforts to streamline our release
processes, which had required many time-consuming manual steps.

At work and at home,  I’m a keen user and advocate of the
keystroke-saving tool [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) and I
dabble in Python.

## Learning

Over the years, I've attended many evening technical talks in Cambridge and London.

A particular focus in recent years has been learning about
[Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and
[Continuous Deployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery).

I’ve developed quite a sophisticated system for capturing things I
learn, and useful references – all stored in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format, in
Dropbox. On PCs, I use [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/)
([Pro](https://markdownpad.com/buy.html)). On iPad, I use
[Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) – where various customised
[actions](http://omz-software.com/editorial/docs/ios_workflows/reference.html) provide
a slick way to transfer information from Twitter and RSS feeds into
Markdown. Both these applications are highly recommended, though sadly neither appears be maintained any more.

## Interests

I love folk music, and am always on the lookout for good music, both
locally and further afield.

Between 1995 and 2010, I was very involved in [Cambridge Cycling
Campaign](http://www.camcycle.org.uk/), including being coordinator for
many years.

For years, I was a keen table tennis player in local leagues,
representing Cambridgeshire, and eventually playing in Grand Prix
tournaments and making it to the UK national ranking list.

These days, although still cycling, more of my spare time goes on
computing projects. Besides Python and Markdown, the current focus is
enjoying the Raspberry Pi that I bought in April 2013, after hearing
Eben Upton’s inspiring keynote talk at the ACCU conference in Bristol.

I’m keen to support local educational computing projects, especially
ones involving the Raspberry Pi.
